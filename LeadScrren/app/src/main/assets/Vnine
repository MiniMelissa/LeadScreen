Management
- For a child whose BLL is approaching 10 Î¼g/dL, more frequent blood lead testing might be appropriate (i.e. in 3-6 months), particularly if the child is aged less than two years old, was tested at the start of warm weather when BLLs tend to increase, or is at high risk for lead exposures.
- Monitor development.  Consider child at risk for developmental delays and behavior problems.
- Provide education such as "What Your Child's Blood Lead Test Means" at health.ny.gov/publications/2526.pdf
