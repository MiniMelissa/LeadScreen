How soon confirm with venous testing?
- No confirmation with venous test unless using LeadCare II device.
- For LCII BLLs ≥ 8: If venous test can be drawn in the office, retest immediately with venous sample and send for analysis at a Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program approved laboratory.  If venous test cannot be drawn, request venous test within 3 months.

When to retest with venous testing?
- May use capillary testing unless using LeadCare II device.  See management which is retesting.

Management
- Recommend retesting in 3-6 months particularly if the child is aged less than 2 years of age, was tested at the start of warm weather when BLLs tend to increase, or is at high risk for lead exposures.
- For children’s BLLs approaching 10 ug/dL recommend retesting in 3-6 months with capillary method.
- Provide education such as 'What Your Child's Blood Lead Test Means' at health.ny.gov/publications/2526.pdf
